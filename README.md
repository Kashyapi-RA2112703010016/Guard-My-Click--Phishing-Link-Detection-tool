GUARD MY CLICK - AI Email Scanner
GUARD MY CLICK is an advanced, automated phishing prevention tool designed to safeguard users from deceptive email scams using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. This project leverages a combination of AI-powered algorithms and fuzzy logic to perform thorough, real-time scanning of email inboxes, identifying potential phishing attempts before they can cause harm.

üîë Key Features
üì¨ Automated Inbox Scanning: Scans the user's Gmail inbox with a single click, identifying phishing threats ethically and efficiently.

üß† Machine Learning Integration: Uses a trained ML model to analyze URLs and email metadata, offering high-accuracy phishing probability scores.

üåÄ Fuzzy Logic Scoring: Evaluates URL structures with heuristic techniques to catch obfuscated and disguised phishing URLs.

‚öñÔ∏è Combined Risk Analysis: Merges ML and fuzzy logic scores for robust and comprehensive threat detection.

üìä Detailed Per-URL Breakdown: Visualizes the threat level of each URL using radar charts, heatmaps, and other interactive data graphics.

üìà Interactive Dashboard: User-friendly web interface built with Bootstrap 5 and Chart.js, offering real-time scanning results and insights.

üö® User Notifications: Real-time browser alerts and optional email notifications for detected threats.

üßæ Downloadable PDF Reports: Generate and download full scan summaries for reporting or review using jsPDF and html2canvas.

üì± Responsive Design: Modern, dark-themed UI optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

üõ† Technologies Used
Frontend:

HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap 5)

JavaScript

Chart.js (visualizations)

jsPDF + html2canvas (PDF generation)

Backend:

Flask (Python Web Framework)

REST API for scan processing

Gmail API for email access

AI/ML:

Hybrid Model: Supervised Learning + Fuzzy Logic Scoring

URL-based phishing detection with feature importance scoring

Notifications:

Web Push Notifications

Email Alerts (via SMTP + secure App Passwords)

üß† How It Works
User clicks "Start Ethical Scan".

Emails are retrieved via the Gmail API.

Each email‚Äôs URLs are extracted and analyzed using ML and fuzzy scoring.

A combined phishing risk score is computed and visualized.

Alerts are triggered if threats are detected.

Full scan results can be explored in the dashboard or exported as a PDF.

üöÄ Getting Started
‚úÖ Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
